# Project Overview

## eBird local sightings using the API and AngularJS

Using the [eBird API][eBird] and developing with [AngularJS][angular] and started with the skeleton project: [AngularJS Seed Project][seed]. The eBird location is currently hard coded to Stratford, Connecticut. I will be creating a search field to find locations.

This project is in development by [Mike Carretta][mike].

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git
cd angular-seed
```

Follow the README.md instructions in the Angular Seed App to get all the npm and bower dependencies.
